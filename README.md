# Project_chatbot
Hey this is a chat board made from Java language it takes input input from the user via audioInput or mic and then it converts it into the string with the help of API named (Sphinx)  and then with the help of Api. The string we got from this is used as a query to fire in another another API of wikipedia that will fetch the data from the internet . Then this fetched data is displayed in the console window as well as printing the data in the console and from that it also speaks the data which it prints in the console using an another API called freetts. We could also use another API named Google speech to text API which could be used as a substitute for (Sphinx) API but it is chargeable services from the Google and  I don't have money so i  used the a free open source API. I'm getting problems with the sphinx API as it needs testing to increase the efficiency as well as to recognise it correctly. For this I have to tech the Sphinx .which is the absolutely new experience for me but i will make it possible.
